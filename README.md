## This is my Second SBA Project for the Per Scholas Web Design essentials class

# https://github.com/kucharze/WDESBA2

This project involves using Javascript to transform data as needed. There are several different functions that will take data
from several different objects and transform them as needed.

## The main data

The main data we are looking at are three objects displaying the following

### A course

### A list of assignments for the course

### A list of all student submissions

We will be reading in this data and outputing a collection of students with their respective grades for all due assignments, and an overall score
for each of these assignments.

Any assignment not due yet will not be counted

There is also appropriate error checking for cases such as mismatching ids
or data types
